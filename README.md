# Face-Recognition
This code was presented as a final project in the Machine Learning course at the College of Computer Science.

This code includes three uses for dealing with facial recognition algorithms and using them in one program that includes a simple graphics interface.

**This code includes three parts, which are as follows:** 
```
  1- Comparing faces and verifying who the person is (the Deepface code was used).
  2- Searching for the person using the face in the data (the Deepface code was used).
  3- Diagnosing mood by analyzing the face and predicting gender, age, and race.
```
